# Owlhacks (won 2nd place out of 15 teams!)
## Inspiration
We were inspired by how much of an impact our own shopping habits have on the environment, and how we could help people make more ethical choices. 

## What it does
Ethena is a chrome extension that allows you to see how ethical a manufactuerer of a product is, and see more ethical alternatives, particularly from local and small businesses. 

## How we built it
We plan to use the Chrome extension API and python precomplied to Javascript (through RapydScript) to build the extension, and vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML on the front end to display the data. Our mockup was made with HTML and CSS.

## What we learned
We learned how to implement APIs in projects, use Github to collaborate in development, and create a prototype. 

## What's next for Ethena
We want to add more features to the extension, including carbon output for products, and introduce a mobile app after completing the extension. First, we would have to make the chrome extension useible.
